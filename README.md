## Tic Tac Toe Game 5

This is an updated version of tictactoe-4 game. 

Here I make draw bigger board on the screen and and add an index to each cell to simplify things if possible.

New Board looks like this.
```
+---------+---------+---------+
|  * * *  |         |    *    |
|  * * *  |    2    |  * * *  |
|  * * *  |         |    *    |
+---------+---------+---------+
|  * * *  |  * * *  |    *    |
|  * * *  |  * * *  |  * * *  |
|  * * *  |  * * *  |    *    |
+---------+---------+---------+
|         |         |    *    |
|    7    |    8    |  * * *  |
|         |         |    *    |
+---------+---------+---------+
```

I added Index to E so that I can print it on Show instance. Does not seem to be a good strategy???
